# A Conjugate Gradient-based solver for the full Stokes equations running on GPUs

This repository contains the work done in my master's thesis project. The goal is to implement a conjugent gradient method that solves the full Stokes equation that arises in ice flow problems. The algorithm will be designed specifically for execution on GPUs using the Julia programming language.
